# 👋 Hello, I'm Taufan

A quiet knight walking between worlds — hotelier by profession, creator by passion.

I'm a seasoned hospitality professional from Indonesia with over a decade of experience in customer service and front office operations. But behind the uniform, I'm a digital artisan — diving deep into 2D/3D game design, reverse engineering, Python development, and UI/UX experimentation. 

This GitHub is where I document my evolution — not just as a coder or designer, but as a human trying to harmonize logic, aesthetics, and meaning.

### ☕ A Bit About Me

- I thrive in silence, but my imagination roars.
- I sleep within seconds, dream in layers, and often wake with full ideas.
- My creations often reflect my inner world: a solitary knight, armored in shadow and purpose.
- I’m not chasing fame, just meaning.
- Coffee? Arabica, no sugar. Just like I like my code — clean and sharp.
